## 👋 About Me

Hey! I'm **Gabriel Henrique**, a software developer truly passionate about technology.  
I love understanding how things work under the hood, solving challenging problems, and building projects from the ground up until they are fully functional in a real environment.

I've been working professionally for about **6 months**, but I've been studying, coding, and building projects for much longer.  
My main focus is **backend development**, but I enjoy understanding the entire ecosystem — from databases to frontend, infrastructure, and deployment workflows.

- **NestJS**
- **React**
- **Next.js**

## 🚀 Development Philosophy

For me, good code solves a real problem **and** remains easy to maintain over time.  
I enjoy working with clean architecture, separation of responsibilities, and scalable folder structures.

Recently, I’ve been using:

- **Docker** to standardize development environments  
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD  
- **Automated testing** to prevent regressions  
- Personal projects to experiment with new ideas and sharpen my skills

## 🎯 What I'm Currently Focusing On

I'm actively improving my backend knowledge with **Node.js** and **TypeScript**, and I'm also diving deeper into:

- Microservices  
- Advanced authentication  
- Payment systems & API integrations  
- Performance and security best practices  
- Scalable architectures  

I’m always looking for real challenges and projects where I can grow and deliver meaningful work.
