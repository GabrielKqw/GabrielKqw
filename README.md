# Gabriel Henrique

## 👋 About Me

Hey! I'm **Gabriel Henrique**, a Software Developer and Cybersecurity student with hands-on experience in technical support, networking, server administration, and full-stack development.

I love understanding how systems work behind the scenes, solving real problems, and turning ideas into functional, scalable solutions.  
Even though I’ve been working professionally for about **6 months**, I’ve been studying and building projects long before that — especially focusing on backend development with Node.js and TypeScript.

My goal is to grow in backend engineering while combining my experience in infrastructure, cloud, and cybersecurity to build reliable and secure systems.

## 🚀 Development Philosophy

To me, good development means writing clean, organized, easy-to-maintain code that truly solves the problem.  
I like structuring systems using clean architecture, separating responsibilities, and ensuring long-term scalability.

I actively use:

- **Docker** for consistent environments  
- **GitHub Actions** for automated pipelines  
- **Automated tests** to prevent unexpected regressions  
- Personal projects to experiment with new architectures and tools
